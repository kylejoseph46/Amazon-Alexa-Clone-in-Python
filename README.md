# Apple-Siri-Clone
I wrote a script in Python that allows for voice recognition and response when the user speaks aloud.
I utilized the pyttsx3 and speech recognition libraries to make this possible.

I named the Siri clone after myself Kyle.
If you say...

"Kyle" aloud, the bot will respond with "How can I help you?". 

"How old are you" aloud it will respond with either "I am ageless", or "You will never find out".

"I love you" aloud it will respond with "I don't know what you mean I can't experience emotion".

"Play Music" aloud, the bot will play music from your music library.

"What is the time" aloud, the bot will respond with the current time.

"Who is {blank}" aloud, the bot will respond with a description of them from Wikipedia".

"Bye Kyle" aloud, the program will stop


I used this user's template: https://github.com/Abhayparashar31, and made adjustments and personalized it to myself.
